# Inbox

This directory serves as a temporary storage area for unprocessed notes, command outputs, and other captured information.

**This directory is for transient, internal data and is not intended for public repositories.** It is recommended to add `inbox/` to your `.gitignore` file to keep temporary and unprocessed information private.

Files in the inbox are meant to be reviewed, processed, and then moved to a more permanent location or deleted if no longer needed.
