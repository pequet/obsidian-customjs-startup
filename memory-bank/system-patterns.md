# System Patterns

## 1. System Architecture Overview

*   **Overall architecture & justification?** *(e.g., Monolithic, Microservices, Client-Server)*

    * [Enter architecture here]

    *   **Example: Project A** The boilerplate follows a modular architecture, where different components (e.g., AI integration, coding standards, documentation) are separated into distinct modules. This allows for easier maintenance, testing, and customization.
    *   **Example: Project B** The project follows a component-based architecture, even within the constraints of Pine Script. A central library of functions for core logic, visualization, and input handling will be developed and used by each individual indicator script, ensuring a modular and maintainable system.

*   **High-Level Diagram Link (Recommended):**

    * [Enter diagram here]

    *   **Example: Project A** N/A - A high-level diagram is not currently available for this boilerplate.
    *   **Example: Project B** N/A - A diagram showing function dependencies could be created later.

## 2. Key Architectural Decisions & Rationales

List significant decisions and why they were made.

* [Enter decisions here]

*   **Example: Project A**
    *   **Decision 1:** Use a `.cursor/rules` directory to define AI behavior.
        *   Rationale: This allows for consistent and predictable AI behavior across all projects, enforcing coding standards and best practices.
    *   **Decision 2:** Integrate with `vibe-tools` for various tasks.
        *   Rationale: `vibe-tools` provides a powerful set of tools for AI-assisted development, including code generation, documentation, and analysis.
    *   **Decision 3:** Implement a memory bank system for improved project context and AI continuity.
        *   Rationale: A memory bank allows the AI to retain project context across sessions, leading to more informed and efficient development.
    *   **Decision 4:** Use Markdown files for documentation and memory bank entries.
        *   Rationale: Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-read format that is well-suited for documentation and knowledge sharing.
*   **Example: Project B**
    *   **Decision 1:** Centralize all common logic into a reusable library. **Rationale:** To enforce consistency, reduce code duplication, and simplify maintenance.
    *   **Decision 2:** Standardize the user input block for all indicators. **Rationale:** To create a consistent user experience and simplify the process of adding new indicators.
    *   **Decision 3:** Separate calculation logic from plotting/visualization logic within each script. **Rationale:** To improve readability and make it easier to debug or modify either part independently.

## 3. Design Patterns in Use

List key software design patterns and where they are used.

* [Enter patterns here]

*   **Example: Project A**
    *   **Pattern 1:** Factory Pattern
        *   Example: Used in `vibe-tools` to create different AI providers and models.
    *   **Pattern 2:** Singleton Pattern
        *   Example: Used to ensure that there is only one instance of the memory bank.
    *   **Pattern 3:** Strategy Pattern
        *   Example: Used to implement different coding standards and best practices based on the project type.
*   **Example: Project B**
    *   **Pattern 1:** Library/Module Pattern. **Example:** The shared `src/core` and `src/visualization` components act as libraries for the individual indicator scripts.
    *   **Pattern 2:** Template Method Pattern (Conceptual). **Example:** Each indicator follows a standard structural template: 1. Inputs, 2. Calculations, 3. Visualization. This ensures consistency.

## 4. Component Relationships & Interactions

Describe how major components interact.

* [Enter interactions here]

*   **Example: Project A**
    *   **Interaction 1:** The Cursor IDE interacts with the `.cursor/rules` directory to enforce AI behavior.
        *   Example: When a developer makes a change to the code, the Cursor IDE uses the rules in `.cursor/rules` to suggest improvements and enforce coding standards.
    *   **Interaction 2:** The `vibe-tools` CLI interacts with AI providers and models to perform various tasks.
        *   Example: When a developer runs a `vibe-tools` command, the CLI sends a request to an AI provider (e.g., OpenAI) to generate code, documentation, or analysis.
    *   **Interaction 3:** The memory bank system interacts with the AI to provide project context and ensure continuity.
        *   Example: When a developer starts a new session, the AI reads the memory bank to understand the project's goals, requirements, and scope.
*   **Example: Project B**
    *   **Interaction 1:** Indicator scripts call functions from the shared component library to perform calculations and visualizations.
    *   **Interaction 2:** The user interacts with the standardized input panel, which passes parameters to the calculation and visualization logic.

## 5. Data Management & Storage

*   **Primary Datastore & Rationale:**

    * [Enter primary datastore here]

    *   **Example: Project A** The primary data store for this project is the file system.
        *   Rationale: The file system is simple, easy to use, and well-suited for storing configuration files, documentation, and memory bank entries.
    *   **Example: Project B** N/A - The project is stateless. All data is provided by the TradingView charting platform in real-time. Configuration is managed via user inputs.

*   **Data Schema Overview/Link:**

    * [Enter data schema here]

    *   **Example: Project A** N/A - There is no formal data schema for this project.

*   **Data Caching Strategies:**

    * [Enter data caching strategies here]

    *   **Example: Project A** N/A - Data caching strategies are not currently implemented in this project.

*   **Data Backup/Recovery Plan:**

    * [Enter data backup/recovery plan here]

    *   **Example: Project A** N/A - Data backup and recovery plans are not currently implemented in this project.

## 6. Integration Points with External Systems

List external services/systems integrations.

* [Enter external systems integrations here]

*   **Example: Project A**
    *   **System 1:** OpenAI
    *   **System 2:** Gemini
    *   **System 3:** GitHub
*   **Example: Project B**
    *   **System 1:** TradingView Platform. The scripts are entirely dependent on the TradingView charting environment and its Pine Script API.
    *   **System 2:** Git/GitHub (for version control and source code management).
