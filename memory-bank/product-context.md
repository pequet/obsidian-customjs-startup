# Product Context

## 1. Problem Statement

*   **Problem being solved for target audience?** *(Be specific)*

    * [Enter problem statement here]

    *   **Example: Project A** Developers waste time and effort setting up new projects with the same basic configurations, integrations, and best practices. This often leads to inconsistencies across projects and hinders productivity.
    *   **Example: Project B** Traders often struggle with cluttered charts and inconsistent indicators that are difficult to interpret and customize. This leads to analysis paralysis and a lack of confidence in their toolset.

*   **Importance/benefits of solving it?**

    * [Enter benefits statement here]

    *   **Example: Project A** Solving this problem allows developers to focus on the unique aspects of their projects, accelerate development cycles, and ensure consistent application of best practices across all projects.
    *   **Example: Project B** Providing a suite of clean, performant, and well-documented indicators with a consistent design language allows traders to build a clear and personalized analytical environment, leading to more efficient and confident decision-making.

## 2. Proposed Solution

        *   Coding standards and best practices
        *   Documentation of the project structure and development workflow
        *   Examples of AI-assisted development workflows
        *   Memory bank system for improved project context and AI continuity
    *   **Example: Project B**
        *   A library of shared Pine Script functions.
        *   High-clarity visual outputs based on data viz best practices.
        *   A standardized framework for user customization.
        *   Comprehensive technical documentation for each script.

## 3. How It Should Work (User Experience Goals)

*   **Ideal user experience?** *(What should it feel like?)*

    * [Enter ideal user experience here]

    *   **Example: Project A** The user should be able to create a new project from the boilerplate with minimal effort and be immediately productive. The boilerplate should provide a clear and intuitive starting point for development, with all the necessary tools and configurations in place.
    *   **Example: Project B** The user should feel empowered by their tools. The indicators should feel responsive, intuitive to read, and easy to customize. The documentation should be clear enough to foster a deep understanding of how the tool works.

*   **Non-negotiable UX principles?**

    * [Enter non-negotiable UX principles here]

    *   **Example: Project A**
        *   Simplicity: The boilerplate should be easy to use and understand, even for developers who are new to AI-assisted development.
        *   Consistency: The boilerplate should enforce consistent coding standards and best practices across all projects.
        *   Flexibility: The boilerplate should be easily customizable and adaptable to different project types.
    *   **Example: Project B**
        *   **Clarity:** Visual outputs must be immediately interpretable.
        *   **Performance:** Indicators must not lag or slow down the user's charting experience.
        *   **Consistency:** All indicators in the suite must share a common design language and user interaction model.

## 4. Unique Selling Proposition (USP)

*   **What makes this different or better than existing solutions?**

    * [Enter USP here]

    *   **Example: Project A** This boilerplate is specifically designed for AI-assisted development in the Cursor IDE, leveraging AI tools and a memory bank system to ensure development continuity and efficiency.
    *   **Example: Project B** This is not a "black box" signal system. It is a suite of transparent, well-engineered, and artfully designed analytical tools for traders who value process and understanding over hype.

*   **Core value proposition for the user?**

    * [Enter core value proposition here]

    *   **Example: Project A** Faster development cycles, consistent application of best practices, and improved project context and AI continuity.
    *   **Example: Project B** A clear, consistent, and performant analytical toolset that fosters understanding and confidence, enabling a more disciplined trading process.

## 5. Assumptions About Users

*   **Assumptions about users' tech skills, motivations, technology access?**
