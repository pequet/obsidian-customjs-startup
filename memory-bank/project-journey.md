# Project Journey

## Core Motivation

Define the core mission and purpose of your project here. What drives you? This is the 'why' behind the project.

* [Enter core motivation here]

*   **Example: Project A** To create the most efficient and intuitive starting point for AI-assisted software development, empowering developers to build great things faster.
*   **Example: Project B** To build a suite of technically robust, artfully designed, and transparently documented trading tools that empower discretionary traders.

## Standard Project Milestones

Adapt the milestones below to fit your project and keep updating them as the project progresses.

**Phase 1: Conception & Setup**
- [ ] M01: **Project Idea Defined & Motivation Documented:** The "Core Motivation" section above is filled out.
- [ ] M02: **Environment Setup:** All required tools are installed and configured.
- [ ] M03: **Version Control Init:** `git init` has been run and the repository is set up.
- [ ] M04: **First Private Commit:** The initial project state has been committed locally.
- [ ] M05: **Framework/Ruleset Established:** The core memory bank files and AI rules are in place.

**Phase 2: Core Development**
- [ ] M06: **[Define and Implement First Core Module]**
    *   **Example: Project A** Finalize the set of AI rules in .cursor/rules/
    *   **Example: Project B** Complete the first version of the shared `visualization` library.
- [ ] M07: **[Define and Implement Second Core Module]**
    *   **Example: Project A** Structure the initial docs/ directory with user guides.
    *   **Example: Project B** Complete the first version of the shared `core` logic library.
- [ ] M08: **[Prototype a Key User-Facing Feature]**
    *   **Example: Project A** Draft the README.md to be a comprehensive guide for new users.
    *   **Example: Project B** Implement the first complete indicator using the new libraries.
- [ ] M09: **[Complete and Refine the Key User-Facing Feature]**
    *   **Example: Project A** Finalize the README.md based on peer feedback.
    *   **Example: Project B** Refine and document the first indicator based on initial testing.
- [ ] M10: **[Establish Basic UI/UX Foundation]**
    *   **Example: Project A** Organize the file structure for maximum clarity and ease of use.
    *   **Example: Project B** Finalize the standard user input framework for all indicators.

**Phase 3: Refinement & Testing**
- [ ] M11: **[Write Unit Tests for Core Modules]**
    *   **Example: Project A** Create a test script to validate the boilerplate setup.
    *   **Example: Project B** Create a standardized manual testing plan for all library functions and indicator outputs.
- [ ] M12: **[Perform Initial Integration Testing]**
    *   **Example: Project A** Test the boilerplate by creating a sample "hello-world" project from it.
    *   **Example: Project B** Test the first three indicators together on a single chart to check for conflicts or performance issues.
- [ ] M13: **[Document Core Systems]**
    *   **Example: Project A** Create detailed documentation for the memory bank files and their purpose.
    *   **Example: Project B** Write complete Markdown documentation for the entire shared component library.
- [ ] M14: **[Perform First Code Refactor Pass]**
    *   **Example: Project A** Review and consolidate the AI rules for clarity and efficiency.
    *   **Example: Project B** Refactor the shared libraries based on lessons learned from building the first three indicators.
- [ ] M15: **[Conduct First User Feedback Session]**
    *   **Example: Project A** Have a developer use the boilerplate for a new project and provide feedback.
    *   **Example: Project B** Provide the first indicator to a small group of alpha testers for feedback on usability and clarity.

**Phase 4: Release & Iteration**
- [ ] M16: **First Public Commit / Release Candidate:** The first version is ready for public view or testing.
- [ ] M17: **README & Public Documentation Ready:** The project's public-facing documentation is complete.
- [ ] M18: **Project Published/Deployed:** The project is live and accessible on GitHub.
- [ ] M19: **[Address Post-Release Feedback/Bugs]**
    *   **Example: Project A** Fix issues reported by users trying to adopt the boilerplate.
    *   **Example: Project B** Address the top issues reported by alpha testers.
- [ ] M20: **[Define Next Major Milestone or Feature]**
    *   **Example: Project A** Plan the integration of a new AI tool or workflow improvement.
    *   **Example: Project B** Plan the next batch of three indicators to be developed.

## Active Quests & Challenges

List the current high-priority tasks or challenges the project is facing.

* [Enter active quests and challenges here]

*   **Example: Project A**
    *   [ ] Q1: Test the boilerplate by creating a sample "hello-world" project from it to ensure it works as expected.
    *   [ ] Q2: Get feedback from another developer on the clarity of the documentation.
*   **Example: Project B**
    *   [ ] Q1: Design a color palette that is both visually appealing and clear for color-blind users.
    *   [ ] Q2: Find an efficient way to manage state within the constraints of Pine Script's execution model.
