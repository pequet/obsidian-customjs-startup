# Technical Context

## 1. Technologies Used
List significant technologies, frameworks, libraries, tools.

* [Enter technologies here]

*   **Example: Project A**
    *   **IDE:**
        *   Cursor IDE
    *   **AI Tools:**
        *   vibe-tools
        *   SpecStory
    *   **Languages:**
        *   Markdown
        *   Bash
        *   JSON
    *   **Version Control:**
        *   Git
*   **Example: Project B**
    *   **Language:** Pine Script v5
    *   **Platform:** TradingView
    *   **Version Control:** Git
    *   **Documentation:** Markdown

## 2. Development Setup & Environment
How to set up the dev environment.

* [Enter development setup and environment here]

*   **Example: Project A**
    *   **Prerequisites:**
        *   Cursor IDE installed and configured.
        *   vibe-tools installed globally (`npm install -g vibe-tools`).
        *   API keys configured for AI providers (e.g., OpenAI, Gemini).
        *   Git installed and configured.
    *   **Setup Steps:**
        1.  Clone the repository from GitHub.
        2.  Install the required dependencies (if any).
        3.  Configure API keys in `~/.vibe-tools/.env`.
        4.  Start the Cursor IDE and open the project directory.
        5.  Review the `README.md` file for further instructions.
    *   **Example: Project B**
        *   **Prerequisites:** A TradingView account (Pro account recommended for development), Git installed, a modern text editor (like VS Code with Pine Script extensions).
        *   **Setup Steps:** 1. Clone the repository. 2. Open the project in a text editor. 3. Copy-paste script code into the TradingView Pine Editor to apply to charts for testing.

## 3. Technical Constraints
List known technical limitations.

* [Enter technical constraints here]

*   **Example: Project A**
        *   Reliance on specific AI tools and extensions.
        *   Potential for redundancy in auto-generated rules.
        *   The boilerplate may become outdated quickly due to the rapid evolution of AI technologies.
        *   The memory bank has a current limit of 2M tokens of context.
    *   **Example: Project B**
        *   Pine Script execution limits (e.g., memory, number of plots).
        *   No ability to import external data sources or libraries beyond the script itself.
        *   All code for a single indicator must be in one file.

## 4. Dependencies & Integrations (Technical Details)
Key technical details for dependencies/integrations.

* [Enter dependencies and integrations here]

*   **Example: Project A**
    *   **Dependency 1:** vibe-tools
        *   vibe-tools provides a set of CLI tools for interacting with AI providers.
    *   **Dependency 2:** SpecStory
        *   SpecStory is a Cursor extension that automatically saves AI interactions.
*   **Example: Project B**
    *   **Dependency 1:** TradingView Platform. The scripts are entirely dependent on the TradingView charting environment and its Pine Script API.

## 5. Code & Branching Strategy
Describe the version control system, branching model, and code review process.

* [Enter version control system, branching model, and code review process here]

*   **Example: Project A**
    *   **VCS:** Git
    *   **Hosting:** GitHub
    *   **Branching Model:** GitHub Flow
    *   **Code Review:** Pull requests
    *   **Commit Messages:** Conventional Commits
*   **Example: Project B**
    *   **VCS:** Git
    *   **Hosting:** GitHub
    *   **Branching Model:** Feature Branch Workflow (e.g., `feature/indicator-name`).
    *   **Code Review:** Pull requests for all changes to the `main` branch.
    *   **Commit Messages:** Conventional Commits standard.

## 6. Build & Deployment Process
Describe the build process, deployment pipeline, and hosting environment.

* [Enter build and deployment process here]

*   **Example: Project A** N/A - This boilerplate does not include a build or deployment process.
*   **Example: Project B** N/A - Deployment is manual. The developer copies the final script code and publishes it as a "Protected" or "Invite-Only" script on the TradingView platform.
