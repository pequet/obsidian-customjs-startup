## 3. Target Audience

Who is this project for? Describe the primary users.

* [Enter target audience here]

*   **Example: Project A** The target audience for this project is software developers, particularly those who are using the Cursor IDE and are interested in incorporating AI into their development workflow. This boilerplate is also suitable for teams looking to standardize their project setup and enforce coding standards.
*   **Example: Project B** The target user is the discerning `Discretionary Trader` i.e. trader (from novice to experienced) who values rigor, transparency, and a deep understanding of their tools, rather than seeking simplistic "buy/sell" signals.
