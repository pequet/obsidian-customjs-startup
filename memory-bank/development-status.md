# Development Status

## Overall Status
The project is stable and ready for its initial public release. The core script is functional and has been refactored for maintainability. All user-facing documentation has been written and finalized.

## What Works
- The `startup.js` script successfully loads and constructs classes specified in an external `.obsidian/customjs-startup.json` file.
- Error handling provides clear feedback in the console if the config file or a specified class file is missing.
- The `README.md` provides clear, comprehensive instructions for installation and usage.

## What's Left
- Final peer review of code and documentation.
- Publishing the repository to GitHub.

## Issues
- No known issues at this time.
