# Active Context

## Current Focus
The project is being prepared for its first public release. The main goal is to finalize all documentation, ensure the script is robust, and provide clear instructions for users.

## Recent Changes
- Refactored the `startup.js` script to load class paths from an external `customjs-startup.json` file.
- Corrected the changelog and added prerequisites to the script's header documentation.
- Completely rewrote the `README.md` to be user-focused and publication-ready.
- All boilerplate and example content is being removed from the memory bank files.

## Next Steps
- Finalize all memory bank documentation.
- Perform a final review of the script and `README.md`.
- Publish the repository to GitHub.
