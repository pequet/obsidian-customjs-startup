# Active Context

## Current Focus
Describe the current focus of the project. What are the main tasks that need to be completed?

* The project is currently in the initialization phase. The project structure is set up, but the memory bank is empty.

*   **Example: Project A** Finalizing all documentation and completing pre-flight checks for the initial public release on GitHub.
*   **Example: Project B** Developing the initial functions for the shared visualization library (`src/visualization`).

## Recent Changes
Describe the recent changes to the project. What has been completed recently?

* Initialized the project from the boilerplate.

*   **Example: Project A** Completed a full review of the memory bank files and their initialization protocols to ensure they are clear and effective for new users.
*   **Example: Project B** Created the initial repository structure and defined the core mathematical model for the first indicator.

## Next Steps

*   Customize the boilerplate for the new project.
*   Review the files in memory-bank and modify them to reflect the project's specific details.
*   Configure the `vibe-tools` and other necessary tools.

*   **Example: Project A**
    *   Execute the final pre-flight checklist.
    *   Publish the repository to GitHub as a public template.
    *   Announce the release and begin gathering user feedback for future refinements.
*   **Example: Project B**
    *   Write and test the `plotLine()` and `colorZone()` functions for the visualization library.
    *   Begin implementing the core logic for the first indicator using the new library functions.
