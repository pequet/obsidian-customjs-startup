# Development Log
A reverse-chronological log of significant development activities, decisions, and findings.

## Template for New Entries

```markdown
*   **Date:** [[YYYY-MM-DD]]
*   **Author(s):** [Name/Team/AI]
*   **Type:** [Decision|Task|AI Interaction|Research|Issue|Learning|Milestone]
*   **Summary:** A concise, one-sentence summary of the activity and its outcome.
*   **Details:**
    *   (Provide a more detailed narrative here. Use bullet points for clarity.)
*   **Outcome:**
    *   (What is the new state of the project after this activity? What was the result?)
*   **Relevant Files/Links:**
    *   `path/to/relevant/file.md`
    *   `[Link to external doc or issue](https://example.com)`
```

## How to Use This File Effectively
