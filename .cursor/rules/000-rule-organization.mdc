# Rule Organization

Rules in this project follow a numeric prefix convention for better organization:

## Numbering System

- **000-099**: Base/core rules (like this one)
- **100-199**: Feature or system-specific rules
- **200-299**: Behavior and methodology rules
  - 200-never-delay-action.mdc
  - 201-initialization-behavior.mdc
  - 210-memory-bank.mdc
- **800-899**: Execution rules
- **900-999**: Index or meta rules

## Special Cases

The following rules do not follow the numeric convention. They are generated by third-party tools.

- **vibe-tools.mdc**: Integration with the Vibe Tools CLI. Do not edit: any manual edits will be overwritten.
- **derived-cursor-rules.mdc**: Auto-generated by Cursor to capture emergent patterns. To prevent duplication, its content should be periodically reviewed and migrated to dedicated, numbered rule files, in accordance with the project's anti-redundancy rule.

## Current Rules

### Base/Core Rules (000-099)
- **000-rule-organization.mdc**: This file, documenting the rule organization
- **001-effective-rule-writing.mdc**: Defines standards for writing clear and actionable rule files

### Feature-Specific Rules (100-199)
- *(No rules in this range yet)*

### Behavior and Methodology Rules (200-299)
- **200-never-delay-action.mdc**: Ensures immediate action when given clear instructions
- **201-initialization-behavior.mdc**: Prompts review of development status at session start
- **202-critical-truthfulness-protocol.mdc**: Prevents AI from fabricating information
- **205-diagnostic-hierarchy-and-assumption-checking.mdc**: Defines a structured process for diagnostics
- **206-direct-integration-of-verified-facts.mdc**: Ensures user-provided facts are treated as ground truth
- **207-timestamp-accuracy-protocol.mdc**: Mandates use of system commands for timestamps
- **210-memory-bank.mdc**: Defines Memory Bank structure and use for project context and AI continuity
- **220-memory-reset-protocol.mdc**: Ensure AI continuity across sessions via a structured memory review
- **230-framework-intelligence.mdc**: Establishes system for tracking project patterns and user preferences
- **240-sequential-thinking-prompt.mdc**: Guide AI to use step-by-step thinking for complex requests
- **245-frontmatter-guidelines.mdc**: Defines standards for using YAML frontmatter
- **250-writing-style.mdc**: Defines quality standards for all written content
- **255-codeblock-formatting.mdc**: Ensures code blocks are easy to copy and paste
- **260-mdc-editing-limitation.mdc**: Reminds AI of limitations in editing .mdc file frontmatter
- **270-avoid-redundancy.mdc**: Prevents duplication of information across the codebase and documentation
- **280-inbox-file-naming.mdc**: Defines naming conventions for files saved to the inbox
- **285-vibetools-output-to-inbox.mdc**: Automates saving vibe-tools output to the inbox
- **290-script-attribution-standards.mdc**: Defines standards for script headers, attribution, and branding
- **295-file-preservation-standard.mdc**: Mandates archiving files instead of deleting them
- **296-operational-file-safety-protocol.mdc**: Never using `rm`, `rm -r`, or `rm -rf` in any script or automated command

### Execution Rules (300-399)
- **300-boilerplate-initialization-protocol.mdc**: Ensures that the boilerplate is initialized correctly

## Adding New Rules

When adding new rules to this project:
1. Choose the appropriate number range based on the rule's purpose
2. Select a specific number that makes logical sense in sequence
3. Name the file with the format: `[number]-[descriptive-name].mdc`
4. Include proper frontmatter with description and configuration
