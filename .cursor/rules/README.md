# Cursor Rules

This directory contains rules that define the behavior and operating parameters for AI assistants like Cursor when working within this project.

**This directory is for internal project configuration and is not intended for public repositories.** It is recommended to add `.cursor/` to your `.gitignore` file to keep these configuration rules private, as they are specific to your development workflow.

These rules help ensure that the AI follows specific guidelines, adheres to project standards, and interacts with the codebase in a consistent and predictable manner.
